Scala functions can't be used as Java 8 functional interfaces, at least not directly, while interoperating between Scala and Java.

**Example:**
```scala
// Scala.scala
class Scala(val x: Option[Int])
```
```java
// Java.java
Scala s = new Scala(scala.Option.apply(1));
// This will not compile saying `scala.Function1<Int, Int>` is not a functional interface
s.x().map(i -> i + 1);
```

Boxed primitives *can be* `null` in Java.

**Problem:** I have a method taking an `Integer` (not an `int`) as parameter. I want to get its byte value but I'm getting `NullPointerException`.

**Question:** How do I work with boxed values of primitives and be null-safe?

**Solution:** Don't, maybe? ðŸ˜‹ If you must, do a null check and convert it to an actual primitive first.

**Example:**
```java
byte getByteUnsafe(Integer i) {
  return i.byteValue();
}

byte getByteSafe(Integer i) {
  int j = i; // or explicitly -> int j = i == null ? 0 : i;
  return j.byteValue();
}

getByteUnsafe(null); // Boom!
getByteSafe(null); // Returns 0.
```

`BlistServlet` doesnâ€™t support overloading for methods with special names (create, index etc.).

**Problem:** I have a REST endpoint to list some items. It is calling some internal service and that service is doing some external calls. At the end of the day, the result of those calls get cached and eventually I get some incorrect (potentially dangerous) data from my endpoint. To disable caching, I would need to modify HTTP headers of the external call the service makes.

**Question:** How do I do that with minimum modifications and without breaking anything?

**Solution:** Create an overloaded version of the service method to add a `disableCache` parameter. Before making the external request, modify the request headers if the flag is set to `true`. Update all calls to the service method and pass `false` to `disableCache` parameter (because we donâ€™t want existing behaviour to change, hence we donâ€™t disable the cache by default). Only pass it `true` from your REST endpoint (or anywhere else where you want to disable the cache).
